		CHANGES IN GeneNet VERSION 1.1.0

Newly added:
- arth800:         new example data from A. thaliana Affymetrix 
                   time series experiment
- ggm.make.dot:    utility function for network plotting 
                   (produces dot files for use with graphviz)
Removed:
- dcor0:           the density and distribution function for correlation
                   have been moved into the "fdrtool" package 
- cor.fit.mixture: this function is not necessary any more, as a similar
                   function is available in the "fdrtool" package

Changes:
- examples scripts were changed to include examples for A.thaliana
  and for plotting using ggm.make.dot() 
- the function ggm.test.edges() was changed internally to use fdrtool()
  rather than cor.fit.mixture() and locfdr() 
- all fdr/Fdr calculations for edge testing are now done using 
  the "fdrtool" package, so the dependency from "locfdr" was removed



		CHANGES IN GeneNet VERSION 1.0.1


- function cor.fit.mixture() was adapted to API changes
  in "locfdr" package
- new dependency requirement: locfdr >= 1.1-1


		CHANGES IN GeneNet VERSION 1.0.0


This is the first standalone release (9 August 2006).
Previously, the functions available in this package were part of
the GeneTS package (version 2.10.2).
